Whether born in the Swamp or to an earth and water genasi parental pair, or imbued by dao and marid magics in the womb, ooze genasi wield the physical mixture of their two elemental connections: skin coated in slippery muck, as well as the ability to summon and manipulate the corrosive substances that pervade the Swamp of Oblivion.",
          "Usually, an ooze genasi's skin has mortal tones, though it secretes a layer of slime or moist mud that varies in thickness based on stress and causes their skin to appear oily with a green or brown tint. It is common for a community to mistake an ooze genasi with a mud coating as a separate type of genasi, referring to them as mud genasi. No matter which coating an ooze genasi's skin has, their hair appears in mortal or brackish hues, and easily becomes greasy if it isn't washed with incredible frequency. Similarly, their eyes are often a muddy brown or oily green."
