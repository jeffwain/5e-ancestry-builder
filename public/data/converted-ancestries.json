While it's unclear why the first gnomes wandered to Eora, this ancestry manifests in modern gnomes as bizarre reasoning, eccentricity, obsessive tendencies, and what some see as naivete. These qualities are further reflected in their physical characteristics, such as spindly limbs, brightly colored hair, and childlike and extremely expressive facial features that further reflect their otherworldly origins.\n\nAlways hungry for new experiences, gnomes constantly wander both mentally and physically, attempting to stave off a terrible ailment that threatens all of their people. This affliction—the Bleaching—strikes gnomes who fail to dream, innovate, and take in new experiences, in the gnomes' absence of crucial magical essence from the First World.\n\nGnomes latch onto a source of localized magic where they live, typically primal magic, as befits their fey lineage, but this isn't enough to avoid the Bleaching unless they supplement this magic with new experiences. The Bleaching slowly drains the color—literally—from gnomes, and it plunges those affected into states of deep depression that eventually claim their lives. Very few gnomes survive this scourge, becoming deeply morose and wise survivors known as bleachlings.",

For this reason, many cultures that are aware of the existence of dust genasi fear their touch, either not knowing that the genasi has full control of their deadly magic or fearing how the genasi might use it.\n\nDust genasi almost always appear emaciated and malnourished, as though their magic is eating them from the inside. While their skin, eyes, and hair can have any mortal hue, they appear desaturated of color, perhaps even having a yellow, tan, or gray caste. Their hair is thin and wispy, almost constantly being whipped about by a phantom cyclone. When a creature sees a dust genasi from their peripheral vision, the genasi's skin and flesh may appear to blow away as particles similar in appearance to their cloud, appearing to leave only animate bone, though looking directly at the genasi or looking away proves this to have been only a trick of the mind."

Many feel most at home near a blacksmith's forge or with a metal weapon in their hands, leading the vast majority of metal genasi to enter a vocation of smithing or warfare.\n\nIt's common for those unfamiliar with metal genasi to initially mistake them for azers or constructs; a metal genasi's skin and hair are almost always glistening metallic tones, such as iron, steel, gold, or bronze, though any type of metal is possible. More often than not, their skin is of a type of metal, and their hair and nails an alloy of that metal, though both their skin and hair are nearly as flexible as any other mortal's. Metal genasi irises, though, burn with an intensity reminiscent of a forge's flame, generally in reds, greens, blues, oranges, or yellows, or even white hot."

It is common for a community to mistake an ooze genasi with a mud coating as a separate type of genasi, referring to them as mud genasi. No matter which coating an ooze genasi's skin has, their hair appears in mortal or brackish hues, and easily becomes greasy if it isn't washed with incredible frequency.
